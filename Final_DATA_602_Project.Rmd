# Motivation


Now more than ever, health data is a major topic in society. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we've been inundated with statistics on infection rates, death rates, $R_0$ values, and many, many more. It has turned many people (for the better or for the worse) into armchair statisticians and data experts. Part of the increase is the wide availability of published data from various forms of governments, as well as the increased availability of tools and the resources to learn how to use them (e.g. R). The effect of these changes required only a catalyst, which COVID has served as, to allow people of all stripes to try their hand at more casual health data investigation.

Though we're investigating our chosen dataset with a less casual interest, the data we're looking at is widely available and has been for decades. Both governments and non-governmental organizations appreciate the value of population data, and there are no shortage of reliable repositories from which we can access the data. Given that we have the tools, the knowledge, and an ongoing grim reminder of the importance of public health, we've chosen exactly that as our data of interest.

Pushing COVID-19 from our minds for a minute, our focus is on public health in non-pandemic years. One of the primary measures when looking at population-level health data is life expectancy, both for its availability and ease of measurement. Though alternatives have been proposed (Stiefel, 2010), they don't have the widespread adoption, nor the clout. In addition to life expectancy, we'd like to investigate several other measurements that we could reasonably expect to be associated with increased longevity. Some of these factors are direct measures of public health, others are influenced heavily by government policy, and more yet are included to allow us to compare countries across the world. Thankfully this data has been collected for decades by the United Nations (UN) and it's related organizations.

When talking about countries at the world level, it would be difficult to compare them without mentioning basic metrics, such as population and gross domestic product (GDP). We hypothesize that GDP, expressed as per capita, will have a significant influence on many of the other public health measures. Availability of education is another metric that we're quite interested in, suspecting that it may be related to a country's GDP, though the direction of the relationship we don't want to speculate on just yet. Aside from GDP, the UN also provides an indicator known as Human Development Index (HDI) that brings together many of these variables. We won't be utilizing HDI, other than its role in classifying "developed" versus "developing" nations.

All of the data we're looking at is sourced from different UN agencies: the World Health Organization, the Global Health Observatory, and the World Bank. These agencies provide high-quality, easily accessible data from the UN's member states. Using this data, we want to analyze the factors that make a country desirable in each health data category, and see if we can identify any correlations. Once we've found variables of interest, we want to see if we can utilize linear regression to predict any missing data values we have, with a focus on life expectancy. The specific measurements we'll be looking at are:

- Human Development Index score of > 0.800 = "Developed"; < 0.800 = "Developing"

**Adult Mortality**
- Rate of both sexes' probability of dying between 15 and 60 years of age (per 1000 population)

**Health Expenditure**
- Expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP (per capita)

**Body Mass Index (BMI)**
- Average body mass index of the population (both sexes) in kg/m^2

**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**
- Gross domestic product of a country (in 2019 USD)

**Life Expectancy**
- Life expectancy at birth, total years (both sexes)

**Population**
- Total population of a country

**Schooling**
- Average number of years of education received by people ages 25 and older, converted from education attainment levels using official durations of each level


# Correlation Plots

First off, we'll construct a correlation plot to identify correlations between our variables of interest. 

## TABLE 1 - correlation plot between all listed variables
```{r}
# Filter numerics, print example data
num_data <- master_data[, c(3,4,6,7,8,9,10)]
head(num_data, 6)

```
```{r}
# Build a correlation
# Drop NA by using use = "complete.obs"

cat("This table chows the numeric correlations between the variables:")

cor_chart <- cor(num_data, method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")
round(cor_chart, 2)


```

We can also visually demonstrate the correlations in a correlation plot, by combining data for all countries and all years:

## FIGURE 1 - Correlation Plot
```{r}
ggcorrplot(cor_chart, hc.order = TRUE, type = "lower", outline.col = "white", lab = TRUE, title = "Correlation Plot of All Numeric Variables")

```
From the above plot, it's clear that the most positively correlated measurement with life expectancy is mean years of schooling, with a correlation coefficient of **0.74** (The highest absolute correlation with life expectancy, adult mortality, is expected, as the two measurements are slightly different ways of measuring the same outcome).

Within our data, the countries have been stratified by their deveopment status (i.e. developing versus developed). There are many factors that go in to how these classifications are made (United Nations, 2020), but we're interested in seeing the relationship between development status and life expectancy:

# Life Expectancy and Development Status

## TABLE 2 - Development status
```{r}
splitted <- master_data %>% 
  select(`Life Expectancy`, Status,`Mean years of schooling`)

splitted = na.omit(splitted)
#splitted, we omit the Not stated data to calculate median properly

detach("package:plyr", unload = TRUE) ##have to unload or summarize won't work

# Show the percentage of data contribution from Developing vs Developed 

splitted  %>% 
  group_by(Status) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(percentage = paste0(round(count/sum(count)*100, 2), "%"))

cat(" To focus on the comparison of Developed vs Developing countries stats summary, we have chosen to omit the NA values in the Splitted Dataframe, this dataframe groups the country's by Status,and includes the two highly correleated variables: Life Expectancy and Mean Years of Schooling. Above is the count of listed Developing Countries versus Developed Countries, the Developing count is significantly higher than developed countries even after dropping NA values.")
```
## FIGURE 2 - Boxplot displaying Median of Developing vs Developed Country Status and Life Expectancy

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(plyr)
# Now I want to plot developing versus developed boxplot reading status versus life expectancy

p_meds <- ddply(splitted, .(Status), summarise, med = median(`Life Expectancy`))


plot1 <-  ggplot(splitted, aes(x=Status, y =`Life Expectancy` , fill = Status)) +
                geom_boxplot() +
                scale_fill_manual(values=c("honeydew", "coral")) +
                labs(x = "Country's Status", y = "Life Expectancy") +
                theme(legend.position = "none") + 
    geom_text (data = p_meds, aes(x = Status, y = med, label = med), size = 3, vjust = -1.5)


# show the plots
plot1
```
Based off the Median line on Developed Countries in the light green boxplot at 77.8, it is clear that developed countries have a much higher mean, median, and inter-qaurtile range for life expectancy.


# Analysis of Variance

Test for estimating life expectancy variable changes according a country's development status. This will test whether there is a difference in means of the groups at each level of the independent variable. Test at signficance level of 0.05. https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/anova-in-r/

$H_0$: There is no difference in a country's development status and its corresponding mean life expectancy 
$H_a$: There is a difference in a country's development status and its corresponding mean life expectancy 

## TABLE 3 - ANOVA of Life Expectancy and Development Status
```{r}
# average varaince summary
summary(aov(`Life Expectancy` ~ Status, data = splitted ))
```
The resulting $p$-value is at $p<0.001$ from the ANOVA test, which is vanishingly small and far less than the significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$. Therefore, we can reject null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the life expectancy of developed versus developing countries.

## FIGURE 3 - Box Plots of Mean Years of Schooling and Development Status 
```{r, warning=FALSE}
q_meds <- ddply(splitted, .(Status), summarise, med = median(`Mean years of schooling`))


plot2 <-  ggplot(splitted, aes(x=Status, y =`Mean years of schooling`  ,  fill = Status)) +
                geom_boxplot() +
                scale_fill_manual(values=c("honey dew", "coral")) +
                labs(x = "Country's Status", y = "Mean years of schooling") +
                theme(legend.position = "none") + 
    geom_text (data = q_meds, aes(x = Status, y = med, label = med), size = 3, vjust = -1.5)


# show the plots
plot2
```
The above box plots show a stark difference in mean years of schooling between developed countries and developing countries, with the median years of schooling being over 4.5 years higher in developed countries (6.2 years versus 10.8 years). Similar to the life expectancy box plots, the mean schooling data shows that even developed countries in the 25th percentile receive more education (on average) than developing countries in the 75th percentile.

## TABLE 4 - ANOVA of Mean Years of Schooling and Development Status

$H_0$: There is no difference in a country's development status and its mean mean years of schhooling 
$H_a$: There is a difference in a country's development status and its mean years of schooling


```{r}
summary(aov(`Mean years of schooling` ~ Status, data = splitted ))
```
As seen above, the ANOVA $p$-value of $p<0.001$ is far smaller than the significance level of $\alpha=0.05$, and we can reject null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in mean years of schooling in developed versus developing countries.

### What is the significance of these tests?

From these simple tests, we want to prove that:
- 1)From the corrrealation plot, the amount of Schooling shows a positive correaltion to Life Expectancy, meaning that a higher education suggests a higher mortality. 
- 2) We now want to see the difference of Life Expectancy between a Developing Country and a Developed County, in other words, we identified that generally speaking Developed country have a longer lifespan. 
- 3) Then, if point two is true, then the average mean years of schooling must also be higher for Developed countries, and with no surprises, we proved that Developed countries recieves a higher education as well.
